# ToyDB Database Management System

The ToyDB and ToyDBServer applications were created in the C# programming language, using Microsoft Visual Studio as the integrated development environment (IDE).

The purpose of these applications are to simulate the operations of a simplified database management system and storage engine.

The ToyDB represents the client side of the application, featuring an interface which allows the user to enter queries and displays the results back to the user.

The ToyDBServer on the hand hand, processes all queries from the client, performs an action based on the command of those queries and returns the result.
